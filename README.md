NPM & Gulp added but not used.  If project needs to be built for production - gulpfile & nodemodule will be need to be 'touched-up'

Background image was converted to .jpeg for better load.  Options remain in the img directory to have conversation with UI / Designer if there are concerns with image quality as background image.

Thank you for the code challenge & opportunity.  -Benusa
